# BrickBreakerGame
THE PROJECT IS A BRICK BREAKER GAME MADE USING THE CONCEPTS OF JAVA SWING AND THE ABSTRACT WINDOW TOOLKIT (AWT). 
THE GAME HAS A GRID OF BRICKS THAT IS BROKEN BY THE BALL AND THE SCORE INCREASES EVERY TIME THE BALL HITS THE BRICK. THE PLATFORM TO CATCH THE BALL IS CONTROLLED USING ARROW KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD.
